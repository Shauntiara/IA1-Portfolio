			<h2> My Top 3 Personality Traits </h2>
			

			<article class="trait-card">
				<h3> 1. Good Leadership Skills</h3>
				<p>My leadership skills has helped me throughout my academic journey by allowing me to perform well in my leadership positions such as 				being head girl.<br>
				Additionally, it helped me to coordinate group projects, delegate tasks, ensure everyone contributes.<br></p>
			</article>

			<article class="trait-card">
				<h3> 2. Determination </h3>
				<p>Once I set my mind on a goal, I don't give up easily. This determination keeps me motivated even when school gets hard.<br>
				It gives me the drive to push through because I know this will all be worth it in the end.</p>
			</article>

			<article class="trait-card">
				<h3> 3. Helping Others Selflessly </h3>
				<p> I enjoy tutoring my classmates whenever difficult topics come up. This strengthens my relationship with my classmates and it also 				allows me to gain a further understanding of topics as I explain them to my classmates.</p>

			<h2> My Hero: My Mother </h2>
			<p> My mother is my hero. Her name is Andrea Lawrence, she was born and raised in Port Maria, St. Mary. She has two children which she loves 			dearly, my sister - Kim-Loy and I.</p>

			<p>What makes my mother my hero is how selfless she is. Her ability to make sure that my sister and I are okay no matter what.<br>
			Even though she is a single parent, she has never struggled to take care of us.</p>

			<p>Whenever I feel down, I remember how she would always tell me that I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.</p>

			<h2>AI for Travel and Hospitality</h2>
			<p> My favourite idea from the <strong> AI Businesses of 2025</strong> is the use of AI for travel and hospitality. <br>
			This idea uses artificial intelligence to turn social media travel videos from Tik Tok and Instagram into bookable itineraries.<br>
		 	I find this fascinating because it connects creativity, social media, and technology in a practical way.</p>	

			<h3> Application in the Real World</h3>
			<p> As a student and traveler, I could use an app like this to plan local trips across Jamaica. As well as summer vacations when school gives 			holiday.<br>
			Instead of manually searching for directions and hotels, the AI could create a travel plan based on videos I've saved or liked.</p>
			<p>This could also benefit small businesses such as guest houses, restaurants, and tour guides by turning their social media content into real 			bookings.<br>
			For education, it could help plan study trips, cultural exchanges, and field trips.</p>

			<h3> Why It Would Be Useful </h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Time-saving</strong> - AI can instantly create travel plans from content you already enjoy.</li>
				<li><strong>Personalised</strong> - Recommendations are based on your interestts and budget.</li>
				<li><strong>Promotes local tourism</strong> - Encourages visitors to explore smaller, less-known destinations.</li>
				<li><strong>Supports small businesses</strong> - Local  creators can showcase unique experiences through content.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3> Ethical Issues and Solutions </h3>
			<table class="table">
			<thead>
				<tr>
					<th>Ethical Concern</th>
					<th>Possible Problem</th>
					<th>Suggestion Solution</th>
			</thead>
			<tbody>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>Data Privacy</strong></td>
					<td>AI systems may collect user data without clear consent.</td>
					<td>Use transparent privacy policies and allow users to control what data is shared.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>Bias</strong></td>
					<td>Popular destinations may be over-represented, ignoring local or diverse voices.</td>
					<td>Train AI on diverse data and include user feedback to ensure fairness.</td>
				</tr>
				<tr>
					<td><strong>Over-Automation</strong></td>
					<td>AI may ignore cultural details or promote over-tourism.</td>
					<td>Combine AI automation with local human input and cultural awareness.</td>
				</tr>
			</tbody>

			<h3> Example App in This Area </h3>
			<p>One real-world example is <strong>GuideGeek</strong> by Matador Network, an AI-powered travel assistant that helps users plan trips through 			chat platforms like WhatsApp and Instagram.</p>
