		<h2 class="section-title">Reflections</h2>
		<h3 class="sub-title">Based on "Twelve Pillars" by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener (Chapters 4-7)</h3>

		<p>
			<em>"Succcess is something you attract by the person you become." - Jim Rohn</em>
		</p>

		<section id="four">
			<h3 class="sub-title">Chapter 4 - Achieve Your Goals</h3>
			<p>
		   	This chapter emphasizes that goals give life direction and purpose. Without goals, we wander without clarity. 
    			Jim Rohn teaches that setting specific, measurable, and time-bound goals helps us design the future we want.  
    			I learned that it’s not enough to “hope” for success — I must plan for it and track my progress consistently.
			</p>
			<p>
			<strong>How it aligns with my life:</strong> I will start setting weekly and monthly academic and personal goals, such as getting an A on my 			course assignments or losing 10 pounds by the end of the month. Writing them down will keep me motivated and accountable.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section id="five">
			<h3 class="sub-title">Chapter 5 - The Proper Use of Time</h3>
			<p>
			Time is one of the most valuable assets in life. The authors explain that successful people use time intentionally — 
    			focusing on what truly matters rather than being constantly “busy.” 
    			They highlight the importance of scheduling priorities, not just prioritizing schedules.
			</p>

			<p>
			<strong>How it aligns with my life:</strong> I often struggle with procrastination, so I plan to create a daily to-do list 
    			and dedicate specific time blocks for study, rest, and self-care. Managing my time better will bring balance and peace to my life.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section id="six">
			<h3 class="sub-title">Chapter 6 - Surround Yourself with the Best People</h3>
			<p>
			This chapter teaches that the people we spend the most time with greatly influence who we become.  
    			Positive, ambitious, and encouraging people lift us higher, while negative influences can hold us back.  
    			“You are the average of the five people you spend the most time with.”
			</p>
			<p>
			<strong>How it aligns with my life:</strong> I will be more mindful of my circle and intentionally build relationships 
    			with classmates, mentors, and friends who encourage growth and positivity.  
    			I’ll also be that kind of positive influence for others.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section id="seven">
			<h3 class="sub-title">Chapter 7 - Be a Life-Long Learner</h3>
			<p>
			Learning doesn’t stop when school ends. Rohn and Widener encourage constant growth through reading, listening, and practicing new skills.  
    			True success comes from curiosity and humility — being open to learning from every experience.
			</p>
			<p>
			<strong>How it aligns with my life:</strong> I will keep learning new technologies, improving my soft skills, and reading motivational books.  
    			I plan to set aside time weekly to read something that inspires or educates me beyond the classroom.
